# hurricane_analysis
This was a Codecademy Pro challenge project designed to give practice creating and working with dictionaries. I answered several prompted questions about the list of hurricanes and various data about them which were provided by Codecademy. It is at their suggestion that I am including a repository for this project.

Honestly, this isn't a very complicated or terribly interesting project. But, it is completed! I used no packages other than the main Python 3.8 installation to complete the hurricane analysis project. So long as you have Python 3.8 installed on your machine, the file should run.

The Python code I wrote is included as MAC_hurricanes_project_solution.py.
